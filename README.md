# Mortgage Calculator
A very simple WebApp to calculate mortgage (because everyone needs one of those, right?).
The form takes 3 parameters, "interest", "amorization", and "principle". If you visit '/Start/branch' you can provide the interest in a range (i.e "3.8-4.2") and the interest will be shown for all values in between.
